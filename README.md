I created this repo to answer the need for calculating working days between two specific datetimes.
The WorkingDayCalculator project, is the heart of the repository, it has several classes.
1- HolydayRegions is an enum indicating Holyday types, whereas it can be SolarHijri, LunarHijri, and Any other cultural holydays or as an example, Victoria.
2- The Days in Holiday Static class, indicates the Holydays for each Region.
3- Calculator class provides the solution for calculation of Working days between dates
