I created this repo to answer the need for calculating working days between two specific date times.
The WorkingDayCalculator project is the heart of the repository, it has several classes.
1- HolydayRegions is an enum indicating Holyday types, whereas it can be SolarHijri, LunarHijri, and Any other cultural holiday, for example, Victoria.
2- The Days in the Holiday Static class, indicate the Holidays for each Region.
3- The calculator class provides the solution for the calculation of Working days between dates
